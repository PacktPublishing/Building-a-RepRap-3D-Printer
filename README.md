This is the code repository for [Building a RepRap 3D Printer [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-a-RepRap-3D-Printer), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course

This video course teaches you how to make a 3D printer for yourself and calibrate and adjust it perfectly. You will get to know how to solve and prevent common problems and discover alternative solutions to tailor your 3D printer to your liking and needs. You will learn how to assemble parts for your 3D printer and build it with ordinary tools and skills. The course starts off with assembling of the Y-Unit and the XZ-Unit before moving on to the extruder and wiring. Next, you will be shown how to execute some simple calibrations and suddenly you're printing in 3D with your very own 3D printer. By the end of the video, you will be a junior 3D printing expert. This 3D printer used for demonstration in this course is especially designed for easy assembly and use, and gives you a head start in building your own 3D-printers for now and for the future.
